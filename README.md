The beginning of a beautiful coding quest
At my core, I am a creator. I love all avenues that give me the opportunity to create. I love to write, to play music with the guitar, violin, or piano, and to draw and paint. And yet, my intellectual side is drawn to deep philosophical discussion, thorough analysis, and interesting challenges. Nothing gives me more joy than when I get to express both my creative and intellectual sides.
